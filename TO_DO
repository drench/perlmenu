Things to do in future releases:

- Allow different rendition indications for various portions of the 
  menus and templates.  Things like "standout", or even colors (using
  standard ANSI or user-specified escape sequences for field rendition).
  This would allow (for example) template fields which had errors in the
  data to be presented in red reverse-video rendition.

- Allow user specification of character-sequences used to perform certain
  generic functions (such as "cursor_up").  You could use a call such
  as the following:

    &menu_key_bind("<function string>","<bound seq>");

- Allow a new "menu_pref" that places "(Done with ..."), etc at bottom of
  menus (instead of at the top).

- Create support for headings within the menu selection items.  These
  strings (really non-selectable items) would be "auto-skipped" during arrow
  movement/selection.

- Allow "multiple column" menus.  Support would examine the length of the 
  longest selection text and the screen width, then place as many items on a
  page as possible (in row/column order).  Would probably be implemented as
  a "menu_pref".
